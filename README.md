## About The Project

This repository aims to use unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify sea ice and leads in satellite imagery and altimetry data from the Arctic. 

For earlier work on using supervised machine learning techniques to classify sea ice and leads, please see my YouTube tutorial from earlier work on the same topic below.
